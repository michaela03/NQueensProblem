# N-Queens Problem ðŸ‘‘â™›

This repository contains a C# implementation of the N-Queens Problem, also known as the "Eight Queens Puzzle". The goal of the problem is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

## Code Description

The `NQueensProblem` program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens Problem. It recursively places queens on the chessboard, checking for conflicts at each step. If a solution is found, it prints the positions of the queens on the board.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. Run the following command to build the program:
5. Run the following command to execute the program:
6. The program will display the solution if one exists, or indicate that there is no solution.
